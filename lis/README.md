# Longest Increasing Sequence

### Input description

A sequence S of postive integers I1,...,In

### Problem description

Distinguish all the possible increasing subsequence from S.

### Example

S = {2,4,3,5,1,7,6,9,8}

The longest subsequence of S has lenght 5, including {2,3,5,6,8}. In fact there are 8 of this length. Can you enumerate them?

### Output

lis -> [{2,3,5,6,8}, ... ,{2,3,5,7,8}]
